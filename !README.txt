Final Project:
  Description:
    Made an animation of a desk that has things moving on it
  Things added:
    animation
    made run_prt work - uses multiprocessing for rendering
    Cylinder class: The normals and end sides(circles) didn't work right
                    so we didn't end up using this in the project
    Complex Meshes: Several complex meshes were used(The Batmobile)
